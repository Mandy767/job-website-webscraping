In this project basically I have done webscraping of a job website naukri.com 
for running this you need to install selenium,beautifulsoup,requests etc
following are the commands:

1.pip install packaging

2.pip install requests

3.pip install selenium

4.pip install beautifulsoup4

The selenium code at start will automatically install chrome webdriver so no need to install it manually.
